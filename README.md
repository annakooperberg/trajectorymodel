### Ballistic Missile Trajectory Model

To Do (soon):

* Fix aerodynamics (seems harder than originally)
* Find better visual (low priority)
* Implement about lofted/depressed trajectories

To Do (later):

* Add mass dm/dt (should be pretty straightforward)
* Separation from booster, add possibility of multiple boosters (I could hard code two boosters, making flexible boosters would probably require using C/C++)
*  Exoatmospheric things, fallout
